1. Todo -list
Design and implement a simple TODO application. Below is an example that you can use as a basis for brainstorming.

## Application requirements:

- The items entered in the field are assembled into a list on the page by pressing the button.
- The content of the input fields must be checked for blank as well as incorrect (eg too short) content
- Incorrect content in the input field causes an error message as well as an incorrect field highlighting (eg red border).
- It must be possible to remove elements from the list and mark the task as done
- The application CSS and JavaScript must be specified in an external CSS file
- The information in the list is stored in a browser, eg localstorage

## Additional functions:

- You may also use drop-down menus and check boxes
- You can implement a counter that shows the number of open items in the list
- Try to come up with some meaningful way to hide and show elements in the app.
- If you wish, you can also use the drag & drop functionality of HTML5 in the list
- You can implement buttons (also shown at the bottom of the image) that only display active or completed tasks

## Key Features

- [Workflows](#workflows) - Workflows run automations. Workflows are sequence of steps - pre-built actions or custom [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code - triggered by an event (HTTP request, timer, new row added to a Google Sheet, and more).
