1. Todo -list
Design and implement a simple TODO application. Below is an example that you can use as a basis for brainstorming.

Application requirements:
The items entered in the field are assembled into a list on the page by pressing the button.
The content of the input fields must be checked for blank as well as incorrect (eg too short) content
Incorrect content in the input field causes an error message as well as an incorrect field highlighting (eg red border).
It must be possible to remove elements from the list and mark the task as done
The application CSS and JavaScript must be specified in an external CSS file
The information in the list is stored in a browser, eg localstorage
Additional functions:
You may also use drop-down menus and check boxes
You can implement a counter that shows the number of open items in the list
Try to come up with some meaningful way to hide and show elements in the app.
If you wish, you can also use the drag & drop functionality of HTML5 in the list
You can implement buttons (also shown at the bottom of the image) that only display active or completed tasks

## Key Features

- [Workflows](#workflows) - Workflows run automations. Workflows are sequence of steps - pre-built actions or custom [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code - triggered by an event (HTTP request, timer, new row added to a Google Sheet, and more).

- [Event Sources](#event-sources) - Sources trigger workflows. They emit events from services like GitHub, Slack, Airtable, RSS and [more](https://pipedream.com/apps). When you want to run a workflow when an event happens in any third-party app, you're using an event source.

- [Actions](#actions) - Actions are pre-built code steps that you can use in a workflow to perform common operations across Pipedream's 500+ API integrations. For example, you can use actions to send email, add a row to a Google Sheet, [and more](https://pipedream.com/apps).

- [Custom code](#code) - Most integrations require custom logic. Code is often the best way to express that logic, so Pipedream allows you to run any [Node.js](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/nodejs/), [Python](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/python/), [Golang](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/go/), or [Bash](https://pipedream.com/docs/code/bash/) code. You can import any package from the languages' package managers, connect to any Pipedream connected app, and more. Pipedream is "low-code" in the best way: you can use pre-built components when you're performing common actions, but you can write custom code when you need to.

- [Destinations](#destinations) - Deliver events asynchronously to common destinations like Amazon S3, Snowflake, HTTP and email

- [Free](#pricing) - No fees for individual developers (see [limits](https://docs.pipedream.com/limits/))
